click on clean.bat
run it as an administrator (important)
it will start cleaning
the screen will be black for some time and will be back to normal
I recomend closing all apps and kill microsoft office and Nvidia process if you know how to do it


Q&A

why is there another file 2.bat?
it will clear event viewer logs, during devlopment of this app it merging event.bat and clean.bat had some problems so there a 2 bat files

should i click 2.bat?
no clicking clean.bat will automaticaly open event.bat

Help! my screen is black!
just wait, if it does not come back to normal adter a long time press ctrl+shift+esc, then click on file, then Run a new task and type explorer and hit enter or reboot you computer

It shows the file is being used by an another program and other errors.
It is ok to ignore it, you can get better results if you close all apps

Why choose windows cleaner

1.Cleans many logs and unwanted files

2.Does not clean the Windows registry, to avoid risking your computer

3.Customize and add/remove functionality to the app because it is a .bat file

4.Trust,anyone can see the code of the.bat file
